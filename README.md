O.S.A.N.A  stands for Open Source AI News Anchor the purpose of this project is to deliver genuine and non biased news to the users by the help of AI generated anchor.

Freemium Model:  We will offer a free basic version of O.S.A.N.A. with core functionalities. For advanced features like in-depth bias reports, historical analysis, or customized news feeds, users could subscribe to a premium tier.

API Monetization: Develop an open API that allows developers and businesses to integrate O.S.A.N.A.'s bias detection and news aggregation functionalities into their own applications or services. Charge a fee for access to the API based on usage..

We have trained a very accurate machine learning model which can predict with more than 95% accuracy whether the news scrapped realtime is genuine or fake. To show the pridictive nature of our ML model I would like to show you the confusion matrix graph of our ml model.

Then we also created a word cloud to show the words used in fake news so the words given below are generally contained by the fake news as predicted by our machine learning model.

The usp of our project is in today's time every news media in India is biased towards some party and people have lost their trust from them but our ML generated news is non biased and if people found the news wrong or misguiding they can report it in Feedback system of our project which is also connected to ML model.

Now I would like to show the basic frontend of our website -
